# Yttr

[![Translation status](http://weblate.sleeping.town/widgets/unascribed-mods/-/yttr/multi-auto.svg)](http://weblate.sleeping.town/engage/unascribed-mods/)

*A mod about the Void, what has gone before, and where you'll go from here.
A vanilla overhaul crossed with a content mod.*

**[Fabric API][fapi] or [QSL][qsl] is required.** [EMI][emi] is strongly recommended.

Check out the official trailer on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54XXPIewsPA) or [PeerTube](https://tube.sleeping.town/w/h67BoBWWy3F81wJTk1tSGp)!

Yttr is an expansive mod for Fabric & Quilt 1.18.2, sort of existing as a love
letter to 1.4-1.6 modded. It contains fresh takes on a lot of common features,
interesting worldgen, custom music, and all-new mechanics.

Starting as a loose collection of useful tidbits, Yttr has grown into a more
cohesive mixture between a content mod and a vanilla overhaul. Presented as three
"content branches", extending those provided by vanilla; Void for the Overworld,
Scorched for the Nether, and Continuity for the End.

The first "progression gate" in Yttr is using the multi-mode Yttric Rifle to
blast an obsidian/diamond spike into the bedrock, smashing it open, revealing a
geyser of liquid Void — created years (or versions) ago due to an alchemical
disaster, also resulting in the creation of the familiar Wasteland biome. After
thorough preparation, you might even be able to dive through the Void to
fast-travel to places you (or your friends (or rivals)) have smashed open
geysers elsewhere. If you're not sufficiently prepared, well, even your items
are not protected from the Void's universal dissolution...

Scorched acts as a complete revamp of the top of the Nether, turning it into an
ominous soot-covered biome, and making it simple to access (because let's be
honest, getting on top of the Nether is not difficult). Your farms won't break,
as nothing can spawn in the Scorched Summit on its natural blocks.

Roots of Continuity can be found underneath floating End islands, and smashing
them with a pickaxe yields a Drop of Continuity and drops the island into the
abyss — however, you may want to watch your back...

Also offered are "abominations", providing a solution to autocrafting and item
sorting that isn't just a block with a funny texture. (Okay, it's a block with
a funny model.) Put a Skeleton on a table, or splice together an Enderman and
Zombie and magically bind them to a hopper — because of course you will just to
make your logistics easier, ~~you monster~~.

Yttr treats crafting more as a mechanic than an interface, tightly integrating
with the world around it. From automatically crushing and bottling gaseous
Shroomlight, to stuffing a skeleton in a snare and feverishly strapping it to a
table, Yttr tries to avoid recipes that can be solved by a digital storage
system. Every recipe type also comes with detailed [EMI][emi] integration.

Also included are a plethora of useful "Vanilla+" pieces — the Dopper, a
dual-output round-robin hopper; the Flopper, a sideways hopper; the Chute,
allowing you to send items downward or center items shot from a Dropper; the
Yttrium Button, a one-tick button; half-tick delayed note blocks, and even a few
more things still.

There's even more to the mod than mentioned here — solvent-weldable plastic
Bloques®, fancy lamps, permanent Neodymium magnets, a centrifuge, Delicaceness
of Deep-Sea Squeeze Trees, multiple new enchantments and curses, a new form of
circuitry derived from InfraRedstone (not yet finished), ...

Check out the [wiki][wiki] for a thorough explanation of ~~everything~~ some
things — it has not yet been updated for the latest version, and is stuck on
v0.4.3. We're working on getting it updated. You can come chat on
[Discord][discord] or [Matrix][matrix] about it, too.
