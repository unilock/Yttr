# Yttr
*Voidtech and other goodies*

A mod about the Void, what has gone before, and where you'll go from here.

A bit of a hodgepodge of random stuff I thought would be cool. It spiralled out of control, and is
now a fairly large content mod with complex lore.

A (successful) attempt at returning to my roots. Don't sweat the details, just have fun making fun.
