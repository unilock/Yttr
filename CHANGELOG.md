* Hypervelic Resin now has no collision, allowing pushing items in from the side or transferring from ice streams
* Various mechanisms are now valid bases for Hypervelic Resin (such as pistons and hoppers)
* Glowdamp can now be thrown, creating a cloud of temporary light and harming undead
* Glowdamp now stacks to 64 (consistent with Dragon's Breath)
* Transferent Fungus spore placement on piston retraction is now much more reliable
* Added IR lazors, which are invisible, do not emit light, and do not harm entities, but are still detectable with redstone
* Added missing EMI recipe defaults
* Slightly reduced lazor brightness for less lag; the full 15 isn't necessary with 1.18 spawn rules
* Possible fix for dyed project tables not showing as dyed in some cases
