# Reinforced Void Cleaver
A direct upgrade to the [Void Cleaver](../cleaver), the Reinforced Void Cleaver inherits its block
cleaving ability (though it requires sneaking, due to this tool's increased utility) but can also
be used as a universal tool and an effective sword.

When used as a sword, it inflicts the Bleeding status effect for 5 seconds, which deals armor-
piercing damage over time. Each hit has a chance to increase the Bleeding effect timer, up to a
maximum of 20 seconds, or increase the level of Bleeding, up to a limit of Bleeding VI. Each hit
additionally deals a bonus 4 damage to a random armor piece. The chances of inflicting or upgrading
Bleeding are affected by how many pieces of armor the target is wearing.

When used as a tool, it provides a mining speed slightly slower than iron, and doesn't take 2x
damage like swords do normally. It works as a stand-in for any tool, and accepts all sword or tool
enchantments.
