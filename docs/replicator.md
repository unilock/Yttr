# Replicator *(0.4.2)*

Replicators are normally-Creative-only items that can infinitely duplicate a given item. They can
be retrieved from the Yttr creative tab, EMI, or /give, whatever you have available.

A Replicator can be placed like a block, and once right-clicked with any item, it will be configured
to produce that item. It can be used with automation such as hoppers, and acts as an infinite source
of full stacks of the configured item.

A Replicator can be pickblocked (or broken in Survival if you have permission to reconfigure it) to
yield an item. The item will work as an infinite stack of what it's holding in a dispenser or
dropper.

A Replicator placed by a Creative player cannot be broken or reconfigured by a Survival player, only
Creative players. A Replicator placed by a Survival player can only be broken or reconfigured by the
player that placed it.
