# Void Cleaver
The Void Cleaver allows making arbitrary cuts in any solid block. The extremely thin and sharp
Glassy Void blade can cut through just about anything, obsidian included. However, it's very
fragile, so it cannot be used to break blocks or as a weapon.

While looking at a full cube block while holding the Void Cleaver, an overlay will appear
consisting of a bunch of dots. Right-clicking on a dot will add it to your cut plan. You need
to select three dots in order to perform a cut; the order you select them in matters. Clockwise
will remove material nearer to you, counterclockwise will remove material further from you.

Once you've selected two points, hovering over a third will show you a red highlight over the
part of the block that will be removed. If you're happy with what is shown, you may right-click a
final time to perform the cut.

After performing a cut, you may left click on another cleavable block to repeat that same cut.
Currently, repeated cuts don't rotate to match changes in facing, and cleaved blocks drop their
original uncut block when broken.

Cutting happens along a plane, meaning you can make any cut that would be possible assuming a very
long blade driven through the block at a precise angle kept completely straight throughout. This
means you cannot make corners, only various kinds of wedges. Multi-cutting will be added Soonâ„¢.
