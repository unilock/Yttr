# Void
Void is a mysterious powerful volatile solvent that fills the entire underside of the Overworld.
It's possible Bedrock is created by stone reacting with Void under pressure.

Breaking a hole into the Void with a [Bedrock Smasher](../bedrock_smasher) allows you infinite access
to Void fluid, which has various uses in Yttr.

Void fluid itself is extremely caustic and dangerous. It will instantly destroy items dropped in it,
and deals damage that causes extra armor damage and bypasses armor damage reduction. Taking Void
fluid damage multiple times in a row will do more damage every time, making it an extremely deadly
substance.

*(0.4.2)*
A cauldron can be filled with a bucket of Void fluid, creating a Void Cauldron that works as an
inventory that destroys anything added to it, such as via hopper or right-click.

Submerging yourself in Void fluid will [greatly increase your FPS](../img/fps.mp4).
