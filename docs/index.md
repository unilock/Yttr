Yttr is a Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.16.5. It also works on 1.16.4 and probably 1.16.3.

Yttr has no specific focus; it's a collection of things I wanted or thought would be useful. That
may sound familiar if you've seen [Fabrication](https://unascribed.com/fabrication/), but unlike
Fabrication, Yttr is a "normal" content mod needed on both the client and server.
