# Yttr

<span style="font-size: 18px">**A huge update for Yttr is on the way, 0.5.0.** It's not currently documented on this wiki, but it's
available now [on Gitea](https://git.sleeping.town/unascribed/Yttr/releases/tag/dev). It's recommended you
use 0.5.0 as it contains many bugfixes and general improvements in addition to the new content. Once
the new Void Filtering content is finished, 0.5.0 will be released and documented.</span>

Yttr is a Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.16.5. It also works on 1.16.4 and probably 1.16.3.

Yttr has no specific focus; it's a collection of things I wanted or thought would be useful. That
may sound familiar if you've seen [Fabrication](https://unascribed.com/fabrication/), but unlike
Fabrication, Yttr is a "normal" content mod needed on both the client and server.

It draws a lot of inspiration from my favorite mods in the 1.4 - 1.6 era.

## FAQ

### **Q: Forge port?**
<span class="big">**A:** ***No.***</span> My other mods support Forge because it's a trivial effort on my part thanks to Forgery,
which automates 90% of the process. A mod like Yttr cannot be ported by Forgery due to the major
differences in adding new content between Forge and Fabric, and I am *not* interested in the work
required to maintain a Forge port. You've already got so much tech content on Forge, anyway.

### **Q: But whyyyyyyyyy?????**
<span class="big">**A:** Quite simply, I don't have fun developing for Forge.</span> Fabric is a
much easier platform for me personally to develop for, and it isn't actively hostile to its
developers just because they're using parts of the API the main dev doesn't like. I also greatly
prefer Yarn mappings to MCP or official Mojang mappings. <small>(Not to say there's nothing wrong
with Fabric. There's plenty wrong. Pick your poison, etc...)</small> I do this as a hobby, for *my
own* enjoyment. It's cool other people like it, but *if it's not fun, why bother*?

### **Q: Why Yttrium?**
<span class="big">**A:** I don't remember.</span> I originally used Yttrium for my first public 1.7 content mod, known as
[Farrago](https://github.com/unascribed-archive/Farrago), which is also the origin of the Yttric
Rifle. A later 1.7 content mod of mine, [Lanthanoid](https://github.com/unascribed-archive/Lanthanoid),
took things further and added a *ton* of lanthanide-family metals to go along with Yttrium. Yttr is
kind of an attempt to return to my roots, so I've chosen to draw more inspiration from Farrago. Back
then I probably just thought Yttrium was a cool metal with a hard-to-say name that no other mods had
used yet.

### **Q: So, how is Yttrium pronounced? How about Yttr?**
<span class="big">**A:** It-reum and It-er</span>, just as the real-world metal. I don't really
care how you say it, though. Lean really hard on that Y if you want. Why-tree-um.
