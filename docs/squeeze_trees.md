# Squeeze Trees
You may randomly find Deep-Sea Squeeze Trees in Deep Ocean biomes. These yellow spongey trees can
be harvested for their stems and leaves. The stems can be crafted into sponges, and the leaves can
be sheared and placed elsewhere to flood areas with water when waterlogged and "squeezed" (right-
clicked).

The undersides of living waterlogged stems additionally ooze Delicace, a pink goo that may be
eaten to grant Delicaceness. While under the effect of Delicaceness, all negative effect durations
are reduced, positive effect durations are increased, and food that is eaten restores more.
